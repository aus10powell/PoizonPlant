# Poizon Plant: A Poison Oak plant computer vision image classifier

## Planned:
Image classifier app to help people avoid getting poison oak is to create a smartphone app that uses 
machine learning algorithms to identify poison oak plants in photos taken by the user. The app could 
use visual recognition technology to analyze the photo and provide the user with a warning if the 
plant in the photo is identified as poison oak. The app could also provide information on how to 
avoid coming into contact with poison oak and what to do if contact occurs. Additionally, the app 
could include a feature that allows users to report locations where poison oak plants are commonly 
found, helping to create a community-generated map of poison oak hotspots. Finally, because of the 
variance in different types of colors and shapes of poison oak, there could be a community upload 
feature for the images where a user might be asked to verify poison oak.
